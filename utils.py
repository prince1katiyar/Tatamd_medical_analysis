#     **Reasoning:**
#     [Explain step-by-step how the symptoms match the disease, citing information from the "Book Context"

#     **Treatment Guidance:**
#     [This section should be comprehensive. If information is not available for a sub-section from the context, state "Information not available in provided context." or "General advice applies:..." rather than omitting the sub-section.]

#         [If no specific drug is mentioned in context for the predicted disease, state that and suggest consulting a doctor for medication options.]

#         **Non-Pharmacological & Lifestyle:**
#         [Suggest other treatments or lifestyle adjustments, e.g.:
#         - Rest: (e.g., Get plenty of bed rest)
#         - Hydration: (e.g., Drink plenty of fluids like water, broth, or electrolyte solutions)
#         - Home Remedies: (e.g., Gargle with salt water for sore throat, use a humidifier)]

#         - **Foods to Avoid:** (e.g., Spicy foods, dairy if causing upset, alcohol, caffeine)]
#         [If no specific dietary advice is in the context, provide general healthy eating tips or state "No specific dietary recommendations from context for this condition."]

#         - Difficulty breathing
#         - High persistent fever (e.g., above 103°F or 39.4°C)
#         - Symptoms worsening significantly or not improving after X days
#         - Chest pain, confusion, etc.]
#         [If no specific red flags in context, state: "Always consult a doctor if symptoms are severe, worsen, or if you have any concerns."]
